A tiny tool for looking up color values on the screen. It is infinitely useful if you're browsing the internet and you see a color you really like, and think it would look absolutely smashing on your homepage.

It is written in C# using Winforms, and thus only works on the Windows platform.
The binary can be found on [this page](http://9bitscience.blogspot.no/p/experiments.html).
